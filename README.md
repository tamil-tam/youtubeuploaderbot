:heavy_exclamation_mark: This project requires [Python3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370 "Python3.7") (as this was written and tested with Python 3.7.3, try and see if it works with other versions)

**Clone and setup virtual environment**

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/midhunkm1294-bit/youtubeuploaderbot.git

$ cd utube

$ virtualenv venv

$ source venv/bin/activate

```

* Head to [Google console](https://console.developers.google.com "Google console"), create a new project named `Youtube Uploader` and enable `API'S AND SERVISES`. Search for `YOUTUBE DATA API v3` and enable the API. Go to [Credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials "Credentials") page, select your project `Youtube Uploader` create a new credential with `other` as type. Copy the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` and paste them to `config.py`

* Paste the bot owner's Telegram id to `BOT_OWNER` and add `AUTH_USERS` if you need others to use your bot.

* _All the contents of `config.py` must be kept secret as they contain sensitive informations_

With all the above procedures done, its time to install our dependencies.

```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

**Run bot**

Lets run our bot for the first time!

### Status

This project is actively maintained and will continue so until I'm tired of it.

### Special notes

* With the Youtube Data API you are awarded with 10,000 points of requests. For one video upload it costs 1605 points, regardless of file size, which calculates to about 6 uploads daily. Once you have exhausted your daily points, you have to wait till daily reset. Resets happens at 0:00 PST, i.e. 12:30 IST. So make your uploads count.

* Uploading copyright contents will leads to immediate blocking of the video, and will not be added to your `MyVideos` section of youtube. But still the video can be played directly through the link provided by the bot.

* All the videos are uploaded as private. You may change it after youtube processes the video.
